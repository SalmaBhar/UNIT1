# Personal Notes on Norman Doors Video

Def: A Norman Door is a door where the design tells you to do the opposite of what you are supposed to do.

### Human-Centered Design Basics:
1. Dicoverability: The ability to discover what operations one can do.
2. Feedback: A signal of what happened.

Observation --> Idea Generation --> Prototyping --> Testing (Repeat)

### Comment
This small issue of bad doors highlights a wider issue on the global scale. Just like there are bad doors in this world, there also bad houses, bad drainage-systems, bad airplanes and so on. I think it is genius to consider this small issue that we usually ignore in our everyday life. That is why products have to be well-designed so it makes tasks easier and more efficient, rather than complicate them.
